Background:
- I'm a developer, and have used professional-development days to  explore AI-related topics such as:
	- how to programmatically use an MCP server
	- how to set up an MCP service that an LLM can use

Goal:
I have another professional-development day, and would like to explore the new approach to using agents by having a "skill" file that LLMs can use to look up necessary info.

Task:
- I know that "skill" AI architectures are still in their infancy, and can be implemented in different ways, but find me three possible tutorials that I can go through to better understand them in terms of concepts, and implementation.

Additional context:
- Our professional-development day is 8-hours, so ideally one could complete the tutorial in a day. (However, if there is a terrific tutorial that exceeds this time-frame, feel free to offer it.)
- I use a Mac-M1 laptop, with 32GB of memory.
- I'm familiar with using Ollama and LM-Studio with open-source models (that can fit on my laptop)
- I'm familiar with using openRouter, and have a free account.

I asked gpt-5.2-deep-research.
- clarification questions and answers:
```
Thanks for the detailed context—very helpful. To make sure I find the best tutorials for you, could you clarify a couple things:
1. Are you specifically interested in open-source frameworks for agent skills (like LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen, or Semantic Kernel), or are you also open to proprietary or cloud-tied systems?
2. Are you leaning toward using Python-based tutorials, or are other languages like TypeScript or Rust acceptable?
3. Do you want these tutorials to be standalone runnable on your Mac, or are cloud dependencies fine?
Once I know that, I’ll start digging up the best options for you.

My clarification -answers:
(1) Open-source frameworks
(2) Language: python
(3) Preference: standalone-runnable on my Mac
```
